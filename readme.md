## Episode 4: Components, Containers, and Client-side Routing

### Summary

Welcome to Chain Reaction!  In this weekly series hosted by Eric Nograles, we will utilize tools and techniques in the React ecosystem for newcomers to get acclimated to the platform.  Additionally, I aim to assist more experienced developers with some techniques of which they may not be aware.

In Episode 4, we begin to use React as a full fledged web application platform.  We will cover the differences between _stateful_ containers and _stateless_ components, as well as integrating [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) for client-side routing.
